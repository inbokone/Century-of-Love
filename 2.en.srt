1
00:01:33,000 --> 00:01:35,880
BAO GONG SHRINE

2
00:02:01,520 --> 00:02:02,720
Tao.

3
00:02:06,120 --> 00:02:07,280
Tao.

4
00:02:08,400 --> 00:02:09,560
Come here.

5
00:02:20,680 --> 00:02:21,920
What is it, Mr. San?

6
00:02:22,640 --> 00:02:23,520
I had a dream last night.

7
00:02:25,560 --> 00:02:28,560
I've studied about dreams quite a bit.

8
00:02:28,640 --> 00:02:30,520
Tell me what you dreamed about.

9
00:02:33,400 --> 00:02:35,000
I dreamed about the guy named Wee.

10
00:02:36,240 --> 00:02:38,360
And… did that.

11
00:02:39,280 --> 00:02:41,440
"That"? What do you mean by "that"?

12
00:02:42,360 --> 00:02:43,480
That.

13
00:02:45,200 --> 00:02:46,680
And when I woke up,

14
00:02:47,680 --> 00:02:48,800
I…

15
00:02:52,280 --> 00:02:53,480
Huh?

16
00:02:54,520 --> 00:02:55,440
Keep it down.

17
00:03:00,880 --> 00:03:01,840
Mr. San.

18
00:03:02,560 --> 00:03:04,440
Doctors like me

19
00:03:04,520 --> 00:03:07,000
only give advice on spiritual matters.

20
00:03:07,080 --> 00:03:11,280
How could I help you
with this kind of stuff?

21
00:03:12,040 --> 00:03:13,840
You're the one I need to talk to.

22
00:03:15,040 --> 00:03:18,280
Because after I swallowed
the Five-Colored Stone 100 years ago,

23
00:03:19,240 --> 00:03:20,200
I…

24
00:03:26,160 --> 00:03:29,200
-You've never gotten a hard-on?
-Hey, Tao!

25
00:03:29,280 --> 00:03:30,760
Keep it down.

26
00:03:30,840 --> 00:03:32,640
Why do you have to be so loud?

27
00:03:33,760 --> 00:03:34,760
What are you talking about?

28
00:03:41,280 --> 00:03:42,600
It's none of your business, Chu.

29
00:03:42,680 --> 00:03:43,880
What?

30
00:03:43,960 --> 00:03:46,080
I heard you say something is not hard.

31
00:03:47,000 --> 00:03:48,280
And how does that concern you?

32
00:03:49,200 --> 00:03:51,000
Get back to work, Chu.

33
00:03:51,080 --> 00:03:52,600
It's adults' matter. Stay out of it.

34
00:03:52,680 --> 00:03:53,560
-Rat.
-What?

35
00:03:53,640 --> 00:03:54,920
-Yes?
-Get Chu back to work.

36
00:03:55,000 --> 00:03:57,240
-Huh?
-Come here, Chu.

37
00:03:57,320 --> 00:03:58,920
Quickly. Come on.

38
00:04:00,360 --> 00:04:02,840
Come on. Come help me with this.

39
00:04:02,920 --> 00:04:04,080
Mr. San.

40
00:04:06,200 --> 00:04:07,880
What was unusable

41
00:04:07,960 --> 00:04:10,360
has become usable again,
after you met Wee.

42
00:04:11,560 --> 00:04:12,880
It's obvious.

43
00:04:12,960 --> 00:04:14,480
He is Ms. Wad,

44
00:04:14,560 --> 00:04:16,200
your destined mate.

45
00:04:17,120 --> 00:04:18,279
Tao.

46
00:04:18,360 --> 00:04:19,800
But he is a man.

47
00:04:19,880 --> 00:04:20,720
Right?

48
00:04:20,800 --> 00:04:23,400
There must be something wrong with this.

49
00:04:23,480 --> 00:04:25,280
Did you get the calculation right?

50
00:04:25,360 --> 00:04:26,920
Try calculating it again.

51
00:04:28,200 --> 00:04:30,760
If so, Mr. San,

52
00:04:31,360 --> 00:04:34,720
you go find out
Wee's date and time of birth.

53
00:04:34,800 --> 00:04:38,480
I'll recalculate it
using every degree and detail.

54
00:04:38,560 --> 00:04:39,640
See if he's the right person.

55
00:05:16,720 --> 00:05:18,240
I'm here, Grandma.

56
00:05:24,840 --> 00:05:28,080
Excuse me.
Where is the patient on this bed?

57
00:05:28,680 --> 00:05:29,680
Huh?

58
00:05:30,960 --> 00:05:31,960
Dead.

59
00:05:32,920 --> 00:05:34,200
Dead.

60
00:05:38,640 --> 00:05:40,320
-Dead.
-Grandma.

61
00:05:44,840 --> 00:05:46,280
Grandma.

62
00:05:51,560 --> 00:05:54,400
Grandma. No, Grandma, don't leave me.

63
00:05:59,000 --> 00:06:00,160
Why are you crying?

64
00:06:00,920 --> 00:06:02,080
Oh, you're not dead?

65
00:06:02,160 --> 00:06:03,240
What?

66
00:06:03,320 --> 00:06:05,200
You just got here and now
jinxed me to death, huh?

67
00:06:06,040 --> 00:06:07,160
Grandma!

68
00:06:08,120 --> 00:06:10,160
-Grandma.
-What's wrong?

69
00:06:10,240 --> 00:06:11,240
What's wrong?

70
00:06:12,040 --> 00:06:16,480
-I thought you're dead.
-Jeez.

71
00:06:17,240 --> 00:06:19,920
Dead.

72
00:06:20,000 --> 00:06:22,560
The patient on that bed is new here.

73
00:06:22,640 --> 00:06:24,960
She's been delirious since she got here.

74
00:06:25,040 --> 00:06:28,480
When someone asked her something,
she only talked about death.

75
00:06:29,280 --> 00:06:34,120
After I left the chemotherapy room,
the nurse moved me to another bed.

76
00:06:34,200 --> 00:06:36,200
I see, but you didn't text me.

77
00:06:36,280 --> 00:06:37,520
I was so scared.

78
00:06:39,960 --> 00:06:42,640
How are you, by the way? Are you okay?

79
00:06:42,720 --> 00:06:44,480
I'm okay.

80
00:06:44,560 --> 00:06:45,480
But…

81
00:06:46,120 --> 00:06:48,920
I didn't sleep well last night.
My body felt uncomfortable.

82
00:06:49,000 --> 00:06:51,560
The wind from the fan didn't reach me.

83
00:06:52,280 --> 00:06:53,680
Do you want to move?

84
00:06:53,760 --> 00:06:55,080
And go where?

85
00:06:55,800 --> 00:06:57,920
The premium rooms are full.

86
00:06:58,680 --> 00:06:59,920
Move to another hospital.

87
00:07:00,640 --> 00:07:01,720
Huh?

88
00:07:02,320 --> 00:07:04,880
I'm entitled to the service here.

89
00:07:04,960 --> 00:07:06,560
Moving to an expensive hospital?

90
00:07:06,640 --> 00:07:08,280
Did you win the lottery or something?

91
00:07:09,200 --> 00:07:11,120
Hey, but if you did win the lottery,

92
00:07:11,200 --> 00:07:14,120
don't spend it on stupid stuff like this.

93
00:07:15,160 --> 00:07:16,880
Save the money.

94
00:07:16,960 --> 00:07:19,400
So if I died, you'd have some to spend.

95
00:07:19,480 --> 00:07:20,920
Remember what I told you?

96
00:07:21,600 --> 00:07:23,840
Don't let the dead
cause trouble for the living.

97
00:07:24,440 --> 00:07:25,680
Oh, Grandma.

98
00:07:26,280 --> 00:07:27,960
But you're still alive now.

99
00:07:28,040 --> 00:07:29,480
I should do whatever I can.

100
00:07:29,560 --> 00:07:34,800
Oh, Wee. Death isn't that scary.

101
00:07:35,360 --> 00:07:36,680
Jeez.

102
00:07:36,760 --> 00:07:38,480
If it makes you so sad,

103
00:07:38,560 --> 00:07:41,240
when I'm dead, just think

104
00:07:41,320 --> 00:07:44,360
I'm living a luxury life somewhere.

105
00:07:44,440 --> 00:07:45,760
As if I were a millionaire.

106
00:07:46,360 --> 00:07:48,880
And just think of me once in a while.

107
00:07:48,960 --> 00:07:51,760
But only think about me being happy.

108
00:07:52,480 --> 00:07:53,400
Got that?

109
00:07:56,480 --> 00:07:57,800
All right.

110
00:07:58,640 --> 00:08:00,440
So, how are you now?

111
00:08:01,040 --> 00:08:03,240
Anything you want to tell me?

112
00:08:03,320 --> 00:08:05,120
Things have been okay.

113
00:08:06,440 --> 00:08:08,560
Right, recently,

114
00:08:08,640 --> 00:08:10,560
I met a guy.

115
00:08:10,640 --> 00:08:12,080
He seemed strange.

116
00:08:12,160 --> 00:08:13,520
How?

117
00:08:13,600 --> 00:08:16,040
He feels familiar like you knew him,

118
00:08:16,960 --> 00:08:18,160
or is it love at first sight?

119
00:08:20,720 --> 00:08:24,880
He doesn't feel familiar at all.
I'm sure I've never met him in my life.

120
00:08:25,680 --> 00:08:27,800
And I don't believe in
love at first sight.

121
00:08:27,880 --> 00:08:29,800
Hey, but it does exist.

122
00:08:29,880 --> 00:08:32,720
-Like I…
-Stop there.

123
00:08:32,799 --> 00:08:36,559
You gonna talk about the handsome man who
saved your life when you're young, right?

124
00:08:36,640 --> 00:08:38,720
You know me well.

125
00:08:39,679 --> 00:08:43,520
Whatever. If he's good, be with him.

126
00:08:43,600 --> 00:08:46,720
Get yourself someone to take care of you,
so I have nothing to worry about.

127
00:08:46,800 --> 00:08:48,440
Oh, Grandma.

128
00:08:48,520 --> 00:08:50,280
Don't worry about me.

129
00:08:50,360 --> 00:08:54,080
I'm good-looking and cute.
It's not hard for me to find a lover.

130
00:08:54,160 --> 00:08:56,920
There's a long line of boys and girls
waiting to hit on me.

131
00:08:57,000 --> 00:09:00,040
Whatever you say.
It's fine if you can find one.

132
00:09:00,120 --> 00:09:02,600
Come on, Grandma, have a banana.
I bought it for you.

133
00:09:02,680 --> 00:09:04,560
Yeah, eating this is good for you.

134
00:09:06,840 --> 00:09:07,680
It's good.

135
00:09:08,320 --> 00:09:10,080
-I know you like it.
-Want some?

136
00:09:10,160 --> 00:09:11,320
Go ahead.

137
00:09:11,400 --> 00:09:13,600
Come on, eat. It's good for you.

138
00:09:14,360 --> 00:09:16,560
See? It's good. One more bite.

139
00:09:32,200 --> 00:09:33,480
Mister.

140
00:09:34,720 --> 00:09:36,000
Mister.

141
00:09:37,920 --> 00:09:39,080
Wait a sec.

142
00:09:40,040 --> 00:09:41,200
Are you paying respect to the goddess?

143
00:09:42,240 --> 00:09:45,320
What a coincidence. I'm also here
to pay respect to the goddess.

144
00:09:45,400 --> 00:09:46,720
It puts your mind at ease, right?

145
00:09:48,080 --> 00:09:49,200
Yeah.

146
00:09:52,760 --> 00:09:55,680
Your ring, there's no damage to it, right?

147
00:09:56,520 --> 00:09:59,720
It looked expensive.
If it's broken, I won't be able to pay.

148
00:10:01,160 --> 00:10:02,080
Yeah.

149
00:10:02,680 --> 00:10:05,520
Nothing is broken. That's all?

150
00:10:05,600 --> 00:10:06,760
Excuse me.

151
00:10:07,320 --> 00:10:08,640
Mister.

152
00:10:14,240 --> 00:10:17,560
You're the only one my heart desires

153
00:10:17,640 --> 00:10:21,600
I've given you my heart

154
00:10:21,680 --> 00:10:25,560
No matter how long, I can wait

155
00:10:25,640 --> 00:10:29,080
If one day I can be close to you

156
00:10:38,360 --> 00:10:39,240
Sorry.

157
00:11:10,720 --> 00:11:12,040
How did it go, Mr. San?

158
00:11:12,720 --> 00:11:13,920
Did it go well?

159
00:11:14,960 --> 00:11:15,800
Did what go well?

160
00:11:16,960 --> 00:11:18,720
I mean…

161
00:11:19,960 --> 00:11:21,680
About Wee's date of birth.

162
00:11:21,760 --> 00:11:24,440
I saw you with him just now.

163
00:11:25,040 --> 00:11:26,160
Did you ask him?

164
00:11:27,240 --> 00:11:28,360
I didn't.

165
00:11:28,440 --> 00:11:30,240
What? Why not?

166
00:11:30,920 --> 00:11:35,040
Didn't you say you wanted to know
if he's the real Ms. Wad?

167
00:11:35,120 --> 00:11:36,280
Why didn't you ask?

168
00:11:37,040 --> 00:11:39,320
The timing was off.

169
00:11:39,400 --> 00:11:42,480
You saw it too. When I saw him,

170
00:11:42,560 --> 00:11:43,560
I could only think of…

171
00:11:45,360 --> 00:11:46,400
Of what?

172
00:11:49,360 --> 00:11:50,640
It's stupid.

173
00:11:51,360 --> 00:11:52,440
You don't need to know.

174
00:11:54,120 --> 00:11:55,280
Ha.

175
00:11:55,360 --> 00:11:57,720
You thought of something
obscene again, right, Mr. San?

176
00:11:58,440 --> 00:12:00,280
You had an obscene dream about him.

177
00:12:00,360 --> 00:12:04,040
When you met him,
you also had an obscene thought.

178
00:12:05,120 --> 00:12:07,680
That's not a good thing to do, Mr. San.

179
00:12:07,760 --> 00:12:10,720
You're more than a hundred years old.

180
00:12:10,800 --> 00:12:13,040
People might say you are

181
00:12:13,120 --> 00:12:15,040
a dirty old lecher.

182
00:12:15,120 --> 00:12:17,120
I'll bite your head off.

183
00:12:27,400 --> 00:12:28,920
Do we have a deal, Chu?

184
00:12:29,000 --> 00:12:30,600
No.

185
00:12:31,480 --> 00:12:32,920
Can't you just help me?

186
00:12:33,000 --> 00:12:36,200
Just find out Wee's date
and time of birth.

187
00:12:36,280 --> 00:12:37,240
What part is so hard?

188
00:12:37,320 --> 00:12:39,920
Huh? If it's easy,
why don't you do it yourself?

189
00:12:40,640 --> 00:12:42,160
He'd think I'm crazy.

190
00:12:42,240 --> 00:12:45,240
Yeah, and you want me to ask him.
Wouldn't he think I'm crazy too?

191
00:12:45,320 --> 00:12:47,640
Great-Great-Grandfather,
quit questioning him.

192
00:12:47,720 --> 00:12:49,920
Wee is Ms. Wad reborn.

193
00:12:50,520 --> 00:12:51,640
No.

194
00:12:52,480 --> 00:12:53,760
That guy isn't Ms. Wad.

195
00:12:53,840 --> 00:12:57,080
Jeez, you dreamed about sleeping with him
one day after you met him.

196
00:12:57,160 --> 00:13:00,400
You can now get hard again,
and you still say he's not the one?

197
00:13:00,480 --> 00:13:02,040
-You…
-Chu.

198
00:13:02,120 --> 00:13:03,880
I told you not to talk about this.

199
00:13:03,960 --> 00:13:06,640
Right. And in front
of Great-Grandfather too.

200
00:13:07,640 --> 00:13:08,560
You two know too?

201
00:13:13,400 --> 00:13:15,760
Tao, I'll kill you.

202
00:13:26,640 --> 00:13:29,320
Suchat, why are you here?

203
00:13:36,920 --> 00:13:37,800
Oh, oh my.

204
00:13:37,880 --> 00:13:39,440
-Hey.
-Uncle.

205
00:13:39,520 --> 00:13:42,640
-Uncle.
-Didn't you hear me? Why are you here?

206
00:13:42,720 --> 00:13:43,840
-Get out.
-Rat.

207
00:13:44,480 --> 00:13:45,480
Calm down.

208
00:13:45,560 --> 00:13:47,240
He's family too.

209
00:13:47,320 --> 00:13:51,840
He's just a distant relative.
Does he even consider us family?

210
00:13:51,920 --> 00:13:53,760
We helped him with so many things.

211
00:13:53,840 --> 00:13:56,560
But in the end, he swindled us.

212
00:13:56,640 --> 00:13:59,120
I did not. I just made
a mistake in investment.

213
00:13:59,200 --> 00:14:00,720
Plus,

214
00:14:00,800 --> 00:14:02,400
that wasn't your money.

215
00:14:02,480 --> 00:14:05,960
It's Great-Grandfather's.
He hasn't even said a word to me.

216
00:14:06,040 --> 00:14:07,400
-Huh?
-Suchat.

217
00:14:08,560 --> 00:14:09,640
Why are you here at this hour?

218
00:14:10,960 --> 00:14:11,840
Great-Grandfather.

219
00:14:12,960 --> 00:14:14,040
I heard that

220
00:14:14,120 --> 00:14:16,000
you found Ms. Wad.

221
00:14:16,080 --> 00:14:18,160
And that she was reborn
as a man named Wee.

222
00:14:19,600 --> 00:14:21,040
Where did you hear that from?

223
00:14:21,960 --> 00:14:22,920
I told him.

224
00:14:26,360 --> 00:14:27,680
Great-Grandfather.

225
00:14:27,760 --> 00:14:30,200
I had my cop friend look into it.

226
00:14:32,720 --> 00:14:36,240
He has a record. It's a fraud case.

227
00:14:36,320 --> 00:14:39,160
He opened a mule account to receive money.

228
00:14:39,240 --> 00:14:40,800
Plus, he's involved
with gambling websites.

229
00:14:44,560 --> 00:14:46,760
CIVIL REGISTRATION

230
00:14:49,160 --> 00:14:50,640
Being a man is one thing.

231
00:14:51,240 --> 00:14:53,480
But he is a swindler.

232
00:14:54,320 --> 00:14:55,760
How could he be Ms. Wad?

233
00:15:50,920 --> 00:15:54,680
After your body

234
00:15:54,760 --> 00:15:58,600
has been tormented by the power
of the Five-Colored Stone

235
00:15:58,680 --> 00:16:00,200
every night,

236
00:16:00,280 --> 00:16:05,600
your body may not be able
to endure the pain.

237
00:16:07,240 --> 00:16:11,920
Your internal organs
may be injured beyond repair.

238
00:16:12,000 --> 00:16:12,960
So,

239
00:16:13,040 --> 00:16:18,680
in order to make your body
endure the pain for a hundred years,

240
00:16:18,760 --> 00:16:21,720
every night of new moon,

241
00:16:21,800 --> 00:16:25,880
your body will recover
and return to its starting point.

242
00:16:25,960 --> 00:16:30,480
Every organ will heal itself,

243
00:16:30,560 --> 00:16:32,760
and you'll return to childhood.

244
00:16:32,840 --> 00:16:36,040
Then at dawn, your body

245
00:16:36,120 --> 00:16:39,800
will return to normal again.

246
00:16:59,560 --> 00:17:01,720
I hate a night like this.

247
00:17:12,560 --> 00:17:17,200
Someone with a record like him
can't be Ms. Wad.

248
00:17:17,280 --> 00:17:19,520
And where is Ms. Wad now?

249
00:17:20,319 --> 00:17:23,960
Boy, if anyone asks,
say you didn't see me, okay?

250
00:17:35,200 --> 00:17:37,840
Hey, boy, did you see
anyone passing through?

251
00:17:41,520 --> 00:17:42,680
What is it? Did you see?

252
00:17:44,960 --> 00:17:47,600
Where did he go? He stole my wallet too.

253
00:17:50,200 --> 00:17:51,520
Let's go look that way.

254
00:18:00,440 --> 00:18:01,440
Thank you very much.

255
00:18:02,360 --> 00:18:04,520
Did you steal his wallet?

256
00:18:06,640 --> 00:18:08,280
No, I didn't steal.

257
00:18:08,360 --> 00:18:10,000
There's a little misunderstanding.

258
00:18:10,960 --> 00:18:12,720
Those two men were harassing a woman.

259
00:18:12,800 --> 00:18:15,120
It's bad, so I warned them a bit.

260
00:18:15,200 --> 00:18:17,120
Then they got mad, and we had a fight.

261
00:18:18,120 --> 00:18:21,040
As for the wallet, it's an accident.

262
00:18:21,120 --> 00:18:22,800
It was caught in the strap of my bag.

263
00:18:24,000 --> 00:18:26,000
I'll mail it back to him.

264
00:18:28,760 --> 00:18:29,800
-Hey.
-Hey.

265
00:18:31,560 --> 00:18:34,160
-Bro.
-So, you're on the same side.

266
00:18:35,640 --> 00:18:39,080
Please calm down. It's a misunderstanding.

267
00:18:39,160 --> 00:18:41,680
Here. Take your wallet back,
and let's forget about this.

268
00:18:43,000 --> 00:18:44,280
Take it.

269
00:18:46,120 --> 00:18:48,360
Run!

270
00:18:48,440 --> 00:18:49,400
-Go.
-Get up.

271
00:18:49,480 --> 00:18:50,920
-Go.
-Go.

272
00:19:21,000 --> 00:19:21,960
Ouch!

273
00:19:24,360 --> 00:19:26,400
Hey! Freeze!

274
00:19:47,120 --> 00:19:48,440
Thank you.

275
00:19:58,000 --> 00:19:59,160
Whoa.

276
00:19:59,880 --> 00:20:01,200
Did they kick you?

277
00:20:01,920 --> 00:20:02,760
They are scum.

278
00:20:02,840 --> 00:20:04,920
It's not their doing.

279
00:20:07,240 --> 00:20:08,280
It's mine, isn't it?

280
00:20:09,240 --> 00:20:11,600
Sorry. It was chaotic.

281
00:20:12,240 --> 00:20:16,120
By the way, why are you out here so late?

282
00:20:16,200 --> 00:20:17,360
Where do you live? I'll take you home.

283
00:20:17,440 --> 00:20:18,440
No need.

284
00:20:18,520 --> 00:20:22,160
Huh? You're acting all cool.

285
00:20:22,240 --> 00:20:24,480
You're just a kid,
but you try to act like an adult.

286
00:20:25,840 --> 00:20:29,360
I helped you, so you have to repay me.

287
00:20:31,760 --> 00:20:33,600
This kid has already learned to be crafty.

288
00:20:34,640 --> 00:20:36,280
All right.

289
00:20:36,360 --> 00:20:38,280
What snack do you want?
I'll go buy it for you.

290
00:20:39,680 --> 00:20:41,640
Not too many, though. I have no money.

291
00:20:51,200 --> 00:20:55,280
I want to know
your date and time of birth.

292
00:20:55,360 --> 00:20:57,000
Your birth place too.

293
00:20:58,360 --> 00:20:59,360
What do you want it for?

294
00:20:59,960 --> 00:21:02,400
I'm not gonna use it for something bad.

295
00:21:37,480 --> 00:21:38,920
Treat your wound.

296
00:21:43,000 --> 00:21:44,760
That kid is weird.

297
00:21:48,520 --> 00:21:52,360
USE AND REUSE, DO IT FOR THE WORLD

298
00:24:01,000 --> 00:24:04,200
How was it, Tao?
Based on Wee's time of birth,

299
00:24:04,280 --> 00:24:05,760
he's not Ms. Wad, right?

300
00:24:08,760 --> 00:24:10,400
Congratulations, Mr. San.

301
00:24:11,240 --> 00:24:12,360
That's a relief.

302
00:24:12,440 --> 00:24:13,840
See?

303
00:24:13,920 --> 00:24:15,280
He surely isn't Ms. Wad.

304
00:24:15,360 --> 00:24:17,440
-He surely is.
-What?

305
00:24:18,320 --> 00:24:20,320
Then why did you congratulate me?

306
00:24:20,400 --> 00:24:22,840
Well. You've waited for him
for almost a hundred years.

307
00:24:22,920 --> 00:24:25,840
You've finally met.
Isn't it a happy occasion?

308
00:24:25,920 --> 00:24:27,640
Plus,

309
00:24:27,720 --> 00:24:31,320
Wee can help you with the reverse ceremony
on the goddess's birthday.

310
00:24:31,400 --> 00:24:34,400
Then you won't have to
die a painful death.

311
00:24:35,560 --> 00:24:36,840
Tao.

312
00:24:36,920 --> 00:24:38,760
Any chance you're wrong
with your prediction?

313
00:24:40,920 --> 00:24:44,440
If there's someone who was born
on the same day in the same year

314
00:24:44,520 --> 00:24:47,040
at the same place, like, exactly,

315
00:24:47,120 --> 00:24:50,520
that person could be Ms. Wad, I guess.

316
00:24:53,040 --> 00:24:56,600
Great-Great-Grandfather, if you can't
accept the fact that he's a man,

317
00:24:56,680 --> 00:24:58,920
you don't have to date him.

318
00:24:59,000 --> 00:25:03,320
Just ask him to help you with
the reverse ceremony, and then part ways.

319
00:25:07,720 --> 00:25:09,480
I've been waiting to be together.

320
00:25:10,080 --> 00:25:11,680
If we meet and then have to part again,

321
00:25:12,400 --> 00:25:15,280
doesn't that mean these 100 years
would go to waste?

322
00:25:24,600 --> 00:25:26,720
-See you tomorrow.
-See you tomorrow.

323
00:25:46,360 --> 00:25:47,520
Oh, hey.

324
00:25:57,000 --> 00:26:01,800
PRIVATE PROPERTY, NO TRESPASSING

325
00:26:09,680 --> 00:26:10,800
Whoa.

326
00:26:11,680 --> 00:26:12,960
Do you own this place?

327
00:26:19,120 --> 00:26:21,040
We've met quite a few times.

328
00:26:21,120 --> 00:26:22,920
I still don't know your name.

329
00:26:25,480 --> 00:26:26,960
It's San.

330
00:26:27,040 --> 00:26:29,280
I see, San.

331
00:26:30,000 --> 00:26:31,360
-I am…
-Wee.

332
00:26:32,400 --> 00:26:35,400
What? How did you know my name?

333
00:26:37,080 --> 00:26:38,480
You asked someone at the store?

334
00:26:39,520 --> 00:26:41,520
Well, if my friend says
something about me,

335
00:26:41,600 --> 00:26:44,680
you have to take it with a grain of salt.
They like to roast me.

336
00:26:48,480 --> 00:26:49,960
Where are we going, by the way?

337
00:27:28,080 --> 00:27:29,400
Why did you bring me here?

338
00:27:31,400 --> 00:27:33,240
I just wanted to prove something.

339
00:27:34,640 --> 00:27:36,040
Do you feel familiar with this place?

340
00:27:43,600 --> 00:27:44,720
No.

341
00:27:58,480 --> 00:28:00,520
Close your eyes and listen until the end.

342
00:28:25,880 --> 00:28:27,320
At this Chinese opera theater,

343
00:28:28,000 --> 00:28:29,520
one hundred years ago,

344
00:28:33,640 --> 00:28:35,320
a woman

345
00:28:35,920 --> 00:28:38,880
sacrificed her life
to save the man she loved.

346
00:28:38,960 --> 00:28:40,040
San!

347
00:28:43,120 --> 00:28:44,880
Ms. Wad.

348
00:28:44,960 --> 00:28:46,120
Ms. Wad.

349
00:28:50,520 --> 00:28:52,080
Ms. Wad.

350
00:29:06,920 --> 00:29:07,960
Ms. Wad.

351
00:29:10,840 --> 00:29:12,280
And that man

352
00:29:12,880 --> 00:29:17,720
did everything so that
he could wait for her return.

353
00:29:19,240 --> 00:29:21,000
No matter how long.

354
00:29:22,160 --> 00:29:23,840
Even if it's a hundred years.

355
00:29:37,160 --> 00:29:40,960
No matter how long, I'll wait

356
00:29:41,040 --> 00:29:45,160
No matter how much I've hurt
It doesn't seem enough

357
00:29:45,240 --> 00:29:51,760
To make me forget you

358
00:29:52,480 --> 00:29:57,680
I just want one chance

359
00:30:00,160 --> 00:30:06,440
Let me tell you what's in my heart

360
00:30:06,520 --> 00:30:10,520
You're the only one my heart desires

361
00:30:10,600 --> 00:30:14,640
-I've given you my heart
-Can you recall anything?

362
00:30:14,720 --> 00:30:18,080
No matter how long, I can wait

363
00:30:18,160 --> 00:30:21,040
If one day I can be close to you

364
00:30:21,120 --> 00:30:24,160
-If that happened to you,
-I'll wait for you here

365
00:30:24,240 --> 00:30:26,000
-how would you feel?
-Though it's torture

366
00:30:26,080 --> 00:30:29,640
You are like the hope of my life

367
00:30:29,720 --> 00:30:31,840
-If it were me,
-Giving me the strength

368
00:30:31,920 --> 00:30:33,480
-I'd be sad.
-To wait for you to say the word

369
00:30:33,560 --> 00:30:35,640
Please come back to listen

370
00:30:35,720 --> 00:30:38,120
But I'd continue living. I wouldn't wait.

371
00:30:41,840 --> 00:30:43,000
Why?

372
00:30:45,480 --> 00:30:46,920
Because death did them part.

373
00:30:47,520 --> 00:30:50,080
I think it's weird
to wait for a dead person.

374
00:30:51,360 --> 00:30:55,320
If it's a novel,
or a movie, or a TV drama,

375
00:30:55,400 --> 00:30:56,760
I think it'd be romantic.

376
00:30:57,760 --> 00:30:59,600
But in reality,

377
00:31:00,400 --> 00:31:02,560
everyone should live their own life.

378
00:31:02,640 --> 00:31:04,360
Waiting for someone

379
00:31:05,160 --> 00:31:07,240
is a waste of time, in my opinion.

380
00:31:09,080 --> 00:31:11,760
You sound as if you're
looking down on that man.

381
00:31:12,320 --> 00:31:14,360
Deeming his love worthless.

382
00:31:14,440 --> 00:31:16,720
I'm not looking down on him.

383
00:31:17,440 --> 00:31:19,560
But if I were the woman,

384
00:31:19,640 --> 00:31:20,960
I wouldn't want anyone to wait.

385
00:31:22,560 --> 00:31:24,840
Let's suppose. Supposing that

386
00:31:24,920 --> 00:31:27,200
somehow a miracle brought me back,

387
00:31:27,280 --> 00:31:30,960
I wouldn't know, in ten years,
or twenty years,

388
00:31:31,040 --> 00:31:32,080
how much I'd change.

389
00:31:32,160 --> 00:31:33,920
I probably wouldn't look the same.

390
00:31:34,000 --> 00:31:37,040
My personality could be so bad
we couldn't get along.

391
00:31:37,120 --> 00:31:39,360
Then our love wouldn't be
the same for sure.

392
00:31:39,440 --> 00:31:40,600
That's enough.

393
00:31:47,520 --> 00:31:50,120
San.

394
00:31:50,880 --> 00:31:52,160
San, wait.

395
00:32:01,320 --> 00:32:02,440
Are you okay?

396
00:32:02,520 --> 00:32:03,640
I'm fine.

397
00:32:05,280 --> 00:32:07,040
San, be careful. He has a knife.

398
00:32:21,160 --> 00:32:23,000
-Hey!
-Ouch!

399
00:32:35,000 --> 00:32:35,880
San.

400
00:32:39,600 --> 00:32:42,200
-Wait here. I'll get an ambulance.
-No need.

401
00:32:43,080 --> 00:32:45,240
What do you mean no? You got stabbed.

402
00:32:45,320 --> 00:32:47,040
I said no!

403
00:32:48,040 --> 00:32:50,560
Was that the guy
you swindled out of money?

404
00:32:50,640 --> 00:32:51,840
And he wanted revenge?

405
00:32:53,080 --> 00:32:54,600
Every time we meet, there's trouble.

406
00:32:55,160 --> 00:32:56,440
Let's not meet again ever.

407
00:34:09,480 --> 00:34:11,040
But if I were the woman,

408
00:34:11,120 --> 00:34:12,520
I wouldn't want anyone to wait.

409
00:34:12,600 --> 00:34:16,159
Supposing that somehow
a miracle brought me back,

410
00:34:16,239 --> 00:34:19,960
I wouldn't know, in ten years,
or twenty years,

411
00:34:20,040 --> 00:34:21,080
how much I'd change.

412
00:34:21,159 --> 00:34:22,920
I probably wouldn't look the same.

413
00:34:23,000 --> 00:34:26,120
My personality could be so bad
we couldn't get along.

414
00:34:26,199 --> 00:34:28,360
Then our love wouldn't be
the same for sure.

415
00:34:28,440 --> 00:34:29,520
That's enough.

416
00:34:39,800 --> 00:34:40,880
Come in.

417
00:34:41,600 --> 00:34:42,760
Mm.

418
00:34:47,679 --> 00:34:48,520
What's the matter, Rat?

419
00:34:49,639 --> 00:34:51,280
I'm here to ask.

420
00:34:51,360 --> 00:34:55,080
Today, you took the kid Wee to
the Chinese opera theater. How did it go?

421
00:34:55,679 --> 00:34:56,760
He couldn't remember anything.

422
00:34:57,880 --> 00:34:59,360
Also, he told me that

423
00:35:00,000 --> 00:35:02,600
if it were him, he wouldn't wait.

424
00:35:02,680 --> 00:35:04,600
He'd continue living his life.

425
00:35:04,680 --> 00:35:07,520
It's been a hundred years.
I guess things have changed.

426
00:35:08,120 --> 00:35:09,240
How could he say that?

427
00:35:09,840 --> 00:35:11,800
I've waited for a hundred years.

428
00:35:11,880 --> 00:35:13,480
But he can't remember a thing.

429
00:35:14,320 --> 00:35:16,600
Uh, Great-Grandfather.

430
00:35:16,680 --> 00:35:21,160
If he can't remember,
doesn't that mean he's not Ms. Wad?

431
00:35:21,240 --> 00:35:22,840
And if that's so,

432
00:35:22,920 --> 00:35:25,800
shouldn't you be happy?

433
00:35:30,960 --> 00:35:32,040
Right.

434
00:35:32,840 --> 00:35:36,080
I should be happy that he's not Ms. Wad.

435
00:35:37,400 --> 00:35:39,000
Now we have nothing to do with each other.

436
00:35:43,520 --> 00:35:44,480
Anything else, Rat?

437
00:35:46,560 --> 00:35:47,520
No.

438
00:35:48,360 --> 00:35:49,800
I'm leaving then.

439
00:36:08,160 --> 00:36:09,080
Here, Great-Grandfather.

440
00:36:19,720 --> 00:36:23,120
I looked more into this guy Wee.

441
00:36:23,720 --> 00:36:25,600
His parents are dead.

442
00:36:25,680 --> 00:36:27,240
He only has a grandmother with cancer.

443
00:36:27,320 --> 00:36:29,160
He's poor.

444
00:36:29,240 --> 00:36:31,400
He's been working his butt off
since he was a kid.

445
00:36:31,480 --> 00:36:34,760
Which is very different from Ms. Wad
who's noble and from a prestigious family.

446
00:36:39,520 --> 00:36:41,320
I took him to the place Ms. Wad died.

447
00:36:42,760 --> 00:36:45,040
If he's the real Ms. Wad,

448
00:36:45,120 --> 00:36:47,760
he should have felt familiar with it,
or recalled something.

449
00:36:48,480 --> 00:36:49,440
But not at all.

450
00:36:56,800 --> 00:36:58,120
Don't worry about it.

451
00:36:59,280 --> 00:37:01,400
I promise you, Great-Grandfather.

452
00:37:01,480 --> 00:37:04,400
I'll find the real Ms. Wad no matter what.

453
00:37:09,200 --> 00:37:10,120
One more thing.

454
00:37:11,400 --> 00:37:12,640
I want to warn you.

455
00:37:13,520 --> 00:37:14,840
What is it about?

456
00:37:14,920 --> 00:37:19,680
I heard there's a morally
questionable businessman

457
00:37:20,360 --> 00:37:22,480
looking for the Five-Colored Stone.

458
00:37:23,240 --> 00:37:25,920
And I think this guy Wee

459
00:37:26,000 --> 00:37:28,000
may be involved with these people.

460
00:37:40,080 --> 00:37:41,800
HALF-PRICE BAKERY

461
00:37:48,080 --> 00:37:49,320
San.

462
00:37:49,400 --> 00:37:51,840
Wait here. I'll get an ambulance.

463
00:37:51,920 --> 00:37:53,280
No need.

464
00:37:53,360 --> 00:37:55,320
What do you mean no? You got stabbed.

465
00:37:55,400 --> 00:37:56,520
I said no!

466
00:37:58,200 --> 00:37:59,640
Every time we meet, there's trouble.

467
00:38:00,240 --> 00:38:01,720
Let's not meet again ever.

468
00:38:14,120 --> 00:38:16,960
Wee! I got it.

469
00:38:17,040 --> 00:38:18,880
-I got it.
-What?

470
00:38:19,600 --> 00:38:21,320
You asked me to look into San.

471
00:38:21,920 --> 00:38:23,680
Really? What did you get?

472
00:38:23,760 --> 00:38:26,440
Well, San is

473
00:38:26,520 --> 00:38:27,960
the grandson of the owner of the market.

474
00:38:28,040 --> 00:38:31,480
This whole area belongs to his family.

475
00:38:33,120 --> 00:38:35,280
But people say he's quite reclusive.

476
00:38:35,360 --> 00:38:36,760
He doesn't leave the house often.

477
00:38:37,440 --> 00:38:41,200
But his house is on Soi Sam over there.

478
00:38:41,280 --> 00:38:42,680
Hey, Ton.

479
00:38:42,760 --> 00:38:45,240
Thank you so much, my best friend.

480
00:38:45,320 --> 00:38:47,440
I did the right thing
asking for your help.

481
00:38:47,520 --> 00:38:48,880
You're welcome.

482
00:38:48,960 --> 00:38:52,160
No one is better than you at putting
your nose in someone else's business.

483
00:38:52,240 --> 00:38:53,600
-Asshole.
-Ow.

484
00:38:53,680 --> 00:38:54,840
I'm helping you here.

485
00:38:54,920 --> 00:38:56,240
It's a compliment.

486
00:38:58,840 --> 00:39:00,840
-Mom.
-Careful with your back.

487
00:39:00,920 --> 00:39:02,040
-It's fine.
-Push it in.

488
00:39:02,120 --> 00:39:04,120
-Well.
-The veggies too.

489
00:39:04,200 --> 00:39:07,280
Grandfather, you should take a break.

490
00:39:07,360 --> 00:39:08,440
Let me help.

491
00:39:10,720 --> 00:39:12,280
You should take a break.

492
00:39:12,360 --> 00:39:14,360
I told you to go wait at the shrine.

493
00:39:14,440 --> 00:39:16,600
Great-Grandfather, let me help you.

494
00:39:21,400 --> 00:39:22,680
Why are you here?

495
00:39:23,280 --> 00:39:24,440
What, sis?

496
00:39:25,320 --> 00:39:26,760
Why can't I be here?

497
00:39:26,840 --> 00:39:28,560
Come on, Rat.

498
00:39:28,640 --> 00:39:30,280
He wants to join us in making merit.

499
00:39:35,400 --> 00:39:37,040
Be careful with that, will you?

500
00:39:37,120 --> 00:39:39,120
-Can't you see people here?
-It's fine to put it there, you know.

501
00:40:03,840 --> 00:40:05,360
All right, come on.

502
00:40:05,440 --> 00:40:08,440
Since it's our market's
annual auspicious day,

503
00:40:08,520 --> 00:40:11,720
Mr. Songwit, aka Xiong,

504
00:40:11,800 --> 00:40:13,600
the owner of the market and his family

505
00:40:13,680 --> 00:40:17,600
collaborated with the shrine
to set up a food pantry.

506
00:40:17,680 --> 00:40:20,120
Everyone who came to pay respect
to the goddess,

507
00:40:20,200 --> 00:40:24,120
don't forget to come get
free delicious vegetarian food.

508
00:40:24,800 --> 00:40:27,840
And don't forget that, in two months,

509
00:40:27,920 --> 00:40:30,120
the 15th day of the waxing moon
of the third lunar month

510
00:40:30,200 --> 00:40:33,160
will be Goddess Nu Wa's birthday.

511
00:40:33,240 --> 00:40:35,160
I invite all of you to our event.

512
00:40:35,240 --> 00:40:36,560
I guarantee

513
00:40:36,640 --> 00:40:39,680
there'll be more giveaways,
and an even bigger event.

514
00:40:39,760 --> 00:40:41,440
Give me the box.

515
00:40:43,600 --> 00:40:45,120
-Hey, Chu.
-Huh?

516
00:40:46,200 --> 00:40:47,240
Hey…

517
00:40:47,840 --> 00:40:48,960
Where are the containers?

518
00:40:49,040 --> 00:40:50,120
They're all gone?

519
00:40:50,920 --> 00:40:52,880
Huh? How could that be possible?

520
00:40:52,960 --> 00:40:55,040
I bought a lot yesterday.

521
00:40:55,120 --> 00:40:56,920
Did you leave some at the house?

522
00:40:57,000 --> 00:40:58,880
-I think I brought them all.
-Here.

523
00:40:58,960 --> 00:41:01,680
-Lots of chopsticks left, but no boxes.
-Thank you for coming.

524
00:41:01,760 --> 00:41:03,920
I bought this much yesterday.

525
00:41:09,800 --> 00:41:13,000
Why did you have to come? You should've
stayed and helped out at the shrine.

526
00:41:13,080 --> 00:41:16,000
Jeez, I'm already here. Stop complaining.

527
00:41:16,080 --> 00:41:17,880
Let's go get it and get back.

528
00:41:33,120 --> 00:41:35,000
Oh my, Grandpa.

529
00:41:41,440 --> 00:41:43,000
-Run, now!
-Help!

530
00:41:43,080 --> 00:41:44,400
Help!

531
00:41:44,480 --> 00:41:46,320
Grandpa!

532
00:41:46,400 --> 00:41:47,440
Grandpa!

533
00:41:48,320 --> 00:41:50,040
What are you going to do?

534
00:41:50,760 --> 00:41:51,640
Chu!

535
00:41:53,960 --> 00:41:55,000
Chu.

536
00:41:55,080 --> 00:41:57,200
Where is the stone?

537
00:41:57,880 --> 00:41:59,200
What stone?

538
00:41:59,280 --> 00:42:02,000
What stone do you want?
There's a lot here. Take what you want.

539
00:42:02,080 --> 00:42:03,080
Stop with the nonsense.

540
00:42:03,160 --> 00:42:05,160
The Five-Colored Stone, where is it?

541
00:42:05,840 --> 00:42:08,320
Are you crazy? What kind of stone
has five colors?

542
00:42:09,320 --> 00:42:11,360
Do you know whose house this is, huh?

543
00:42:12,080 --> 00:42:12,960
Don't!

544
00:42:13,920 --> 00:42:15,880
Grandpa!

545
00:42:16,480 --> 00:42:17,640
Where?

546
00:42:17,720 --> 00:42:18,920
Huh?

547
00:42:20,640 --> 00:42:22,400
Chu.

548
00:42:26,360 --> 00:42:27,640
Don't.

549
00:42:36,720 --> 00:42:37,920
Great-Grandfather.

550
00:42:41,600 --> 00:42:43,400
They're here to steal
the Five-Colored Stone.

551
00:42:44,800 --> 00:42:46,760
How dare you hurt my people?

552
00:43:18,400 --> 00:43:20,200
Who sent you here
to take the Five-Colored Stone?

553
00:43:33,400 --> 00:43:34,280
Get her inside.

554
00:43:34,880 --> 00:43:36,360
-Great-Grandfather
-Great-Great-Grandfather

555
00:43:45,480 --> 00:43:47,080
-Suchat, why are you here?
-Great-Grandfather.

556
00:43:47,160 --> 00:43:48,880
I saw Wee just now.

557
00:43:49,440 --> 00:43:50,640
Something's wrong with his friend.

558
00:43:51,760 --> 00:43:53,440
Easy there. Easy.

559
00:43:53,520 --> 00:43:54,680
Friend?

560
00:43:55,720 --> 00:43:57,760
Suchat, go to the house and find Xiong.

561
00:43:57,840 --> 00:43:59,320
-Take him to the hospital.
-Yes.

562
00:44:03,720 --> 00:44:05,240
San!

563
00:44:05,840 --> 00:44:06,800
San!

564
00:44:11,640 --> 00:44:13,240
What's this about?

565
00:44:13,840 --> 00:44:14,680
Who sent you?

566
00:44:15,360 --> 00:44:16,440
I called a car on an app.

567
00:44:16,520 --> 00:44:17,920
Quit the nonsense.

568
00:44:18,560 --> 00:44:20,840
Who did you send off in the taxi?

569
00:44:21,800 --> 00:44:23,040
Oh.

570
00:44:23,120 --> 00:44:24,560
I just met them.

571
00:44:24,640 --> 00:44:26,840
They're injured,
so I called a cab for them.

572
00:44:26,920 --> 00:44:28,240
Liar.

573
00:44:28,320 --> 00:44:31,280
I saw you helping them. Are you with them?

574
00:44:31,360 --> 00:44:32,680
Please calm down.

575
00:44:32,760 --> 00:44:34,920
This doesn't seem right.
I think you got it wrong.

576
00:44:35,680 --> 00:44:36,600
I'm not wrong.

577
00:44:37,640 --> 00:44:39,640
They tried to steal something in my house.

578
00:44:39,720 --> 00:44:40,880
They hurt my people.

579
00:44:42,400 --> 00:44:44,040
I have nothing to do with it.

580
00:44:44,680 --> 00:44:47,120
I just met them.
I didn't know they're thieves.

581
00:44:47,200 --> 00:44:50,360
Don't act all innocent.
You're a thief too, aren't you?

582
00:44:50,960 --> 00:44:52,760
You have a police record.

583
00:44:55,320 --> 00:44:56,880
You did a background check on me?

584
00:44:56,960 --> 00:44:58,240
Of course.

585
00:44:58,880 --> 00:45:01,280
That's why I'm sure you came
with an ulterior motive.

586
00:45:02,200 --> 00:45:04,360
Tell me. Who sent you?

587
00:45:04,440 --> 00:45:06,320
I told you, no one sent me!

588
00:45:06,960 --> 00:45:08,920
This is getting out of hand.

589
00:45:09,000 --> 00:45:10,360
What did I ever do to you?

590
00:45:10,440 --> 00:45:12,000
You're always mad at me
every time we meet.

591
00:45:12,080 --> 00:45:14,160
You talk rudely to me. You pick fights.

592
00:45:14,680 --> 00:45:16,680
Why do you hate me so much, huh?

593
00:45:17,720 --> 00:45:19,480
I hate people who deceive others.

594
00:45:20,120 --> 00:45:22,240
I heard you need money for
your family member's medical treatment.

595
00:45:22,840 --> 00:45:24,800
Is that why you do everything for money?

596
00:45:27,120 --> 00:45:29,400
What right do you have
to dig into my personal info?

597
00:45:29,480 --> 00:45:31,600
And you're looking down on me, huh?

598
00:45:31,680 --> 00:45:33,040
Then tell me.

599
00:45:33,120 --> 00:45:35,480
Why did you suddenly show up
in my neighborhood?

600
00:45:35,560 --> 00:45:37,320
Are you gonna say
you just happened to come by?

601
00:45:37,400 --> 00:45:39,320
You got stabbed the other day.

602
00:45:39,400 --> 00:45:40,840
I was worried, so I came to visit you.

603
00:45:41,760 --> 00:45:43,480
But it seems you're doing just fine now.

604
00:45:43,560 --> 00:45:45,240
I'm sorry, then.

605
00:45:45,320 --> 00:45:47,040
I was stupid for butting in.

606
00:45:57,520 --> 00:45:58,920
Dammit.

607
00:46:33,360 --> 00:46:36,560
I'm sorry, boss.
We searched the whole place.

608
00:46:36,640 --> 00:46:37,960
But we couldn't find it.

609
00:46:49,800 --> 00:46:51,040
I'm sorry.

610
00:47:08,040 --> 00:47:09,880
The Five-Colored Stone.

611
00:47:11,640 --> 00:47:13,880
I need to get it.

612
00:47:38,120 --> 00:47:40,440
It's not new moon tonight.

613
00:47:40,520 --> 00:47:43,080
Hey, kid, do you live here?

614
00:47:44,200 --> 00:47:45,280
The goddess' opinion

615
00:47:45,360 --> 00:47:47,040
as to why Mr. San turned into a kid

616
00:47:47,120 --> 00:47:48,720
even though it's not new moon.

617
00:47:50,000 --> 00:47:51,400
Is there a way to fix it?

618
00:47:54,040 --> 00:47:54,920
What do you want?

619
00:48:45,960 --> 00:48:47,960
