BAO GONG SHRINE

00:02:32,760 --> 00:02:39,320
1924

3
00:04:49,280 --> 00:04:51,520
Have you seen
a wounded man running this way?

4
00:04:52,480 --> 00:04:53,840
He's with a triad.

5
00:04:59,120 --> 00:05:00,280
He ran off that way.

6
00:05:08,600 --> 00:05:10,080
Why asked if you wouldn't believe me?

7
00:05:12,040 --> 00:05:13,520
I see.

8
00:05:14,240 --> 00:05:15,920
You must be Viscount Dab's men.

9
00:05:16,000 --> 00:05:17,840
I recently heard

10
00:05:17,920 --> 00:05:20,360
if any Chinese traders
offend the viscount,

11
00:05:20,440 --> 00:05:22,120
he'll claim they're with a triad.

12
00:05:22,200 --> 00:05:24,760
-You!
-Hold on.

13
00:05:27,240 --> 00:05:28,480
Calm down.

14
00:05:29,120 --> 00:05:30,520
This is Ms. Wad,

15
00:05:30,600 --> 00:05:31,840
Duke Phichitphusit's daughter.

16
00:05:36,360 --> 00:05:37,760
I'm sorry, Ms. Wad.

17
00:05:49,880 --> 00:05:51,200
Oh.

18
00:06:01,520 --> 00:06:02,840
You're safe now.

19
00:06:08,920 --> 00:06:10,440
Hey, Mister?

20
00:06:10,520 --> 00:06:11,560
Mister?

21
00:06:12,320 --> 00:06:13,720
Mister?

22
00:06:16,120 --> 00:06:17,480
Mister?

23
00:06:17,560 --> 00:06:19,560
Hang in there, Mister.

24
00:06:20,520 --> 00:06:21,840
We're here.

25
00:06:23,480 --> 00:06:24,800
Mister! Ow.

26
00:06:27,280 --> 00:06:29,160
Pao, where's the doctor?

27
00:06:31,480 --> 00:06:32,600
Pao.

28
00:06:32,680 --> 00:06:34,200
What's wrong with you?

29
00:06:36,560 --> 00:06:39,120
-Doctor, please help.
-Miss.

30
00:06:39,200 --> 00:06:40,160
San.

31
00:06:42,240 --> 00:06:43,520
-San?
-Mister?

32
00:06:43,600 --> 00:06:44,880
San?

33
00:06:44,960 --> 00:06:46,200
Mister?

34
00:06:58,480 --> 00:06:59,600
Doctor.

35
00:08:56,520 --> 00:08:58,080
Uh, Doctor?

36
00:08:59,600 --> 00:09:00,760
What's that stone?

37
00:09:00,840 --> 00:09:02,640
How could it glow?

38
00:09:02,720 --> 00:09:05,080
And how could it heal his wound?

39
00:09:05,160 --> 00:09:09,280
It's the Five-Colored Stone
from Goddess Nu Wa.

40
00:09:13,360 --> 00:09:16,640
Goddess Nu Wa is a mother goddess
who created humans.

41
00:09:17,240 --> 00:09:19,440
According to the legend,

42
00:09:19,520 --> 00:09:22,920
there was once a leak in the sky.

43
00:09:23,000 --> 00:09:26,200
As a result,
the human world faced disasters,

44
00:09:26,280 --> 00:09:30,040
evil spirits and demons ran amok,
leaving chaos in their wake.

45
00:09:30,720 --> 00:09:33,320
She had to use
this magical five-colored stone

46
00:09:33,400 --> 00:09:36,480
to caulk the leak in the sky.

47
00:09:36,560 --> 00:09:39,200
From that day forward,

48
00:09:39,280 --> 00:09:43,360
humans have been living in happiness.

49
00:09:45,600 --> 00:09:47,160
So you're saying…

50
00:09:47,240 --> 00:09:49,320
It's ok if you don't believe me

51
00:09:49,400 --> 00:09:52,200
and think it's an absurd tale,

52
00:09:52,280 --> 00:09:54,640
But we believe

53
00:09:54,720 --> 00:09:55,960
this stone

54
00:09:56,040 --> 00:09:59,680
is a fragment of
the Five-Colored Stone left on earth.

55
00:10:01,280 --> 00:10:03,920
I don't think it's absurd.

56
00:10:04,000 --> 00:10:05,480
In this world,

57
00:10:05,560 --> 00:10:07,680
there are many things beyond imagination.

58
00:10:55,680 --> 00:10:56,720
Ms. Wad.

59
00:11:00,760 --> 00:11:02,160
You know me?

60
00:11:03,920 --> 00:11:05,760
I heard the men hunting me call you.

61
00:11:05,840 --> 00:11:07,160
My name is San.

62
00:11:09,120 --> 00:11:10,880
But I'm not with a triad like they said.

63
00:11:11,640 --> 00:11:13,000
I used to have a mill

64
00:11:13,080 --> 00:11:14,440
and I offended their boss.

65
00:11:14,520 --> 00:11:15,840
I've been framed.

66
00:11:17,360 --> 00:11:18,440
I believe you.

67
00:11:18,520 --> 00:11:21,080
Doctor Hong already told me.

68
00:11:28,440 --> 00:11:30,640
I'm in your debt, Ms. Wad.

69
00:11:31,240 --> 00:11:33,200
I'll never forget your kindness.

70
00:11:35,240 --> 00:11:37,440
If you ever need my help,

71
00:11:38,120 --> 00:11:39,800
just say the word.

72
00:11:39,880 --> 00:11:41,400
I'll do anything.

73
00:11:43,520 --> 00:11:46,240
San, please get up.

74
00:11:47,680 --> 00:11:50,680
I helped you because I wanted to.

75
00:11:51,280 --> 00:11:52,840
I didn't expect anything in return.

76
00:11:59,920 --> 00:12:00,760
Oh.

77
00:12:01,280 --> 00:12:02,640
Get up slowly.

78
00:12:06,080 --> 00:12:07,520
I'm useless.

79
00:12:08,680 --> 00:12:10,760
I haven't even repaid you

80
00:12:11,760 --> 00:12:13,560
and here I need your help again.

81
00:13:16,160 --> 00:13:17,400
Thank you.

82
00:13:46,120 --> 00:13:46,960
You like the blue one?

83
00:13:47,560 --> 00:13:49,560
It's beautiful. It's perfect for you.

84
00:13:55,680 --> 00:13:56,880
Wad!

85
00:13:59,960 --> 00:14:00,880
Prince Trai.

86
00:14:10,000 --> 00:14:11,680
Father!

87
00:14:11,760 --> 00:14:13,360
Stop crying.

88
00:14:13,440 --> 00:14:14,760
Today's your wedding day.

89
00:14:14,840 --> 00:14:16,640
The prince is perfect for you.

90
00:14:17,480 --> 00:14:18,600
Father!

91
00:14:19,760 --> 00:14:21,520
Father!

92
00:14:21,600 --> 00:14:24,000
But I don't wanna get married.

93
00:14:24,840 --> 00:14:25,920
Father!

94
00:14:28,440 --> 00:14:29,760
Father!

95
00:14:33,160 --> 00:14:34,160
Father.

96
00:14:38,640 --> 00:14:39,960
San.

97
00:14:41,520 --> 00:14:42,680
San.

98
00:14:47,240 --> 00:14:48,600
Let's get out of here, Ms. Wad.

99
00:15:27,760 --> 00:15:28,640
Let's go.

100
00:15:57,160 --> 00:15:59,560
Ms. Wad, let's hide in here for now.

101
00:16:07,960 --> 00:16:09,160
Wad.

102
00:16:09,240 --> 00:16:10,680
Come home with me right now.

103
00:16:11,600 --> 00:16:12,440
No.

104
00:16:19,360 --> 00:16:20,200
San.

105
00:16:21,240 --> 00:16:22,720
Wad doesn't love you.

106
00:16:25,720 --> 00:16:26,880
-Stay back.
-Mr. San.

107
00:16:41,520 --> 00:16:43,400
You took Wad from me!

108
00:16:43,480 --> 00:16:44,680
San!

109
00:16:51,280 --> 00:16:52,120
Ms. Wad.

110
00:16:53,000 --> 00:16:54,000
Ms. Wad.

111
00:16:55,760 --> 00:16:57,000
Wad.

112
00:16:59,560 --> 00:17:00,960
Ms. Wad.

113
00:17:02,320 --> 00:17:04,160
Your Highness.

114
00:17:04,240 --> 00:17:05,800
Let San go.

115
00:17:07,359 --> 00:17:08,760
Let…

116
00:17:09,520 --> 00:17:11,200
Let San go.

117
00:17:22,160 --> 00:17:23,119
Ms. Wad.

118
00:17:25,359 --> 00:17:26,200
San.

119
00:17:38,600 --> 00:17:39,480
Ms. Wad.

120
00:17:43,720 --> 00:17:44,640
Ms. Wad.

121
00:17:44,720 --> 00:17:46,240
Ms. Wad.

122
00:17:46,320 --> 00:17:48,040
Ms. Wad!

123
00:17:49,000 --> 00:17:50,480
Ms. Wad!

124
00:17:50,560 --> 00:17:52,120
Ms. Wad!

125
00:17:52,720 --> 00:17:54,480
Ms. Wad!

126
00:17:54,560 --> 00:17:55,880
Ms. Wad!

127
00:18:15,080 --> 00:18:18,600
BAO GONG SHRINE

128
00:18:18,680 --> 00:18:20,120
Doctor!

129
00:18:20,200 --> 00:18:21,160
Doctor!

130
00:18:21,240 --> 00:18:22,480
Doctor!

131
00:18:23,320 --> 00:18:24,280
Doctor!

132
00:18:24,360 --> 00:18:25,240
Ms. Wad.

133
00:18:26,160 --> 00:18:27,440
Doctor!

134
00:18:29,160 --> 00:18:30,400
Doctor!

135
00:18:30,480 --> 00:18:31,680
Doctor!

136
00:18:32,360 --> 00:18:33,560
-What happened, San?
-Doctor!

137
00:18:33,640 --> 00:18:34,680
Please help Ms. Wad.

138
00:18:34,760 --> 00:18:36,080
Doctor.

139
00:18:46,880 --> 00:18:48,240
Doctor.

140
00:18:49,280 --> 00:18:51,960
The stone. Doctor, the Five-Colored Stone.

141
00:18:52,600 --> 00:18:55,600
The Five-Colored Stone
can only save the living.

142
00:18:55,680 --> 00:18:58,320
But Ms. Wad has passed.

143
00:19:01,680 --> 00:19:02,720
That's not true.

144
00:19:03,400 --> 00:19:04,400
It's not true, Ms. Wad.

145
00:19:04,480 --> 00:19:07,120
Ms. Wad! You can't die!

146
00:19:07,200 --> 00:19:08,600
Ms. Wad!

147
00:19:13,960 --> 00:19:15,680
Meeting leads to leaving.

148
00:19:15,760 --> 00:19:17,200
Leaving leads to ending.

149
00:19:17,280 --> 00:19:20,120
You can't fight fate, San.

150
00:19:20,840 --> 00:19:22,560
Make peace with it.

151
00:19:22,640 --> 00:19:24,200
Ms. Wad's gone to a better place.

152
00:19:24,280 --> 00:19:27,320
If you two share a destiny,

153
00:19:27,400 --> 00:19:29,440
you'll meet in the next life.

154
00:19:30,400 --> 00:19:32,400
What if we don't, Doctor?

155
00:19:32,920 --> 00:19:35,400
I haven't even repaid Ms. Wad's kindness.

156
00:19:36,240 --> 00:19:39,880
I need to see her again, Doctor.
Please help me.

157
00:19:41,480 --> 00:19:42,760
Doctor!

158
00:19:52,280 --> 00:19:54,440
Doctor, please help me. Doctor.

159
00:19:54,520 --> 00:19:56,520
This is all my fault.

160
00:19:57,360 --> 00:19:59,440
She died because of me.

161
00:20:00,360 --> 00:20:02,640
Doctor, I wanna see her one more time.

162
00:20:03,320 --> 00:20:06,400
Doctor, it's my fault.
This is all my fault, Doctor.

163
00:20:06,480 --> 00:20:08,480
Or I'll die right here. Please help me.

164
00:20:08,560 --> 00:20:10,080
Doctor, help me.

165
00:20:10,160 --> 00:20:12,840
I wanna see her one more time, Doctor.

166
00:20:12,920 --> 00:20:15,960
Doctor, if you don't help me,
I'll die right here. Doctor.

167
00:20:16,040 --> 00:20:19,360
Doctor, I wanna see her one more time.

168
00:20:19,440 --> 00:20:21,000
San!

169
00:20:32,360 --> 00:20:33,280
Actually…

170
00:20:34,840 --> 00:20:36,640
there's another way.

171
00:20:46,480 --> 00:20:48,760
The 15th day of the waxing moon
of the third lunar month

172
00:20:48,840 --> 00:20:52,080
is Goddess Nu Wa's birthday.

173
00:20:52,160 --> 00:20:55,560
We can perform
a 100-year destiny ceremony.

174
00:20:55,640 --> 00:20:56,480
This ceremony

175
00:20:56,560 --> 00:21:00,840
will tie together
your and Ms. Wad's souls.

176
00:21:03,840 --> 00:21:07,280
I'm gonna divide
the Five-Colored Stone into two parts.

177
00:21:07,360 --> 00:21:08,960
You'll consume the first half.

178
00:21:09,600 --> 00:21:11,680
With the power of the stone,

179
00:21:11,760 --> 00:21:14,720
your lifespan will be
extended for 100 years

180
00:21:14,800 --> 00:21:18,320
with your body maintained
in its current condition.

181
00:21:23,480 --> 00:21:26,040
But every night from now

182
00:21:26,120 --> 00:21:29,000
you will have to endure pain

183
00:21:29,080 --> 00:21:32,800
as your body will be tortured
by the Five-Colored Stone poison

184
00:21:32,880 --> 00:21:34,760
running throughout your system

185
00:21:34,840 --> 00:21:38,560
until you meet Ms. Wad once she's reborn.

186
00:21:38,640 --> 00:21:42,080
Have her feed you
the other half of the stone.

187
00:21:42,160 --> 00:21:43,440
Your body

188
00:21:43,520 --> 00:21:45,560
will then return to normal.

189
00:21:55,800 --> 00:21:57,560
What if I wait until then

190
00:21:57,640 --> 00:21:59,440
and still haven't found her?

191
00:22:00,560 --> 00:22:04,280
You have 100 years to find Ms. Wad.

192
00:22:05,200 --> 00:22:07,160
If on the centenary,

193
00:22:07,240 --> 00:22:11,000
the 100th year's 15th day of
the waxing moon of the third lunar month,

194
00:22:11,600 --> 00:22:13,840
you haven't performed
the reverse ceremony,

195
00:22:14,720 --> 00:22:18,760
your body will slowly decompose.

196
00:22:19,400 --> 00:22:23,360
You'll experience
the most excruciating pain in your life

197
00:22:24,240 --> 00:22:27,320
until your body breaks down
and turns into dust.

198
00:22:31,920 --> 00:22:33,000
San,

199
00:22:33,560 --> 00:22:35,640
you can still change your mind.

200
00:22:38,040 --> 00:22:39,480
I'll do anything.

201
00:22:40,480 --> 00:22:42,160
I'll face torment.

202
00:22:43,040 --> 00:22:45,000
As long as Ms. Wad and I

203
00:22:45,840 --> 00:22:47,640
get to share a destiny again.

204
00:23:59,120 --> 00:24:02,920
With the power of
Goddess Nu Wa's Five-Colored Stone,

205
00:24:03,000 --> 00:24:06,560
you will live for another 100 years!

206
00:24:06,640 --> 00:24:11,360
I hope you find Ms. Wad,
your soulmate, San!

207
00:24:47,720 --> 00:24:53,600
1944

208
00:24:54,120 --> 00:24:58,480
You're here again, San.

209
00:24:58,560 --> 00:25:01,080
I'm waiting where Ms. Wad passed away,

210
00:25:01,680 --> 00:25:04,800
hoping to hear the news of her return.

211
00:25:07,200 --> 00:25:09,040
I already told you

212
00:25:10,080 --> 00:25:14,280
Ms. Wad is tied to the other half
of the Five-Colored Stone.

213
00:25:15,440 --> 00:25:17,600
When the heavens approves

214
00:25:18,160 --> 00:25:21,520
and the goddess
allows you to find Ms. Wad,

215
00:25:21,600 --> 00:25:25,280
the Five-Colored Stone will give a signal.

216
00:25:29,440 --> 00:25:31,320
But it's been 20 years, Doctor.

217
00:25:32,640 --> 00:25:34,840
How long does the goddess
expect me to wait?

218
00:25:39,680 --> 00:25:43,160
SHRINE CARETAKER, FIRST GENERATION

219
00:25:47,360 --> 00:25:51,120
1974

220
00:25:58,280 --> 00:26:00,480
Pao, is she Ms. Wad?

221
00:26:16,640 --> 00:26:21,520
SHRINE CARETAKER, SECOND GENERATION

222
00:26:25,120 --> 00:26:28,920
2004

223
00:26:29,000 --> 00:26:31,720
SHRINE CARETAKER, THIRD GENERATION

224
00:26:39,720 --> 00:26:40,560
Wang,

225
00:26:41,160 --> 00:26:42,320
is it her?

226
00:26:59,560 --> 00:27:04,360
2024 (100th year)

227
00:27:16,000 --> 00:27:20,760
PRIVATE PROPERTY, NO TRESPASSING

228
00:28:13,120 --> 00:28:13,960
Grandfather.

229
00:28:16,280 --> 00:28:19,000
What are you doing
out here at this hour, Xiong?

230
00:28:19,080 --> 00:28:20,520
Uh…

231
00:28:20,600 --> 00:28:23,600
I've noticed it's cold out tonight.

232
00:28:23,680 --> 00:28:25,840
I was worried you'd get a fever

233
00:28:25,920 --> 00:28:27,760
so I came out to look for you.

234
00:28:27,840 --> 00:28:30,200
I've been with you since you were born.

235
00:28:30,840 --> 00:28:32,360
Have you ever seen me get a fever?

236
00:28:34,240 --> 00:28:37,320
You know that aside from
the Five-Colored Stone poison,

237
00:28:37,400 --> 00:28:39,720
no diseases can harm me.

238
00:28:41,960 --> 00:28:43,560
Grandfather?

239
00:28:45,080 --> 00:28:47,000
Even if you don't get a fever,

240
00:28:47,720 --> 00:28:50,120
you must at least feel cold.

241
00:28:50,800 --> 00:28:53,400
So I prepared you a hot drink.

242
00:28:54,920 --> 00:28:56,040
Please have some.

243
00:28:56,120 --> 00:28:57,000
Enough.

244
00:28:57,080 --> 00:28:57,920
Oops.

245
00:29:01,160 --> 00:29:02,360
Grandfather.

246
00:29:03,360 --> 00:29:04,280
Grandfather.

247
00:29:17,240 --> 00:29:19,000
Get up already, Xiong.

248
00:29:19,920 --> 00:29:22,720
No, I'm gonna kneel here.

249
00:29:22,800 --> 00:29:24,760
I'm ungrateful.

250
00:29:25,400 --> 00:29:26,800
I hurt you.

251
00:29:27,840 --> 00:29:30,080
I know you didn't mean to.

252
00:29:31,160 --> 00:29:33,720
In fact, I've been indebted
to all of you for decades

253
00:29:33,800 --> 00:29:35,200
for taking care of me.

254
00:29:41,920 --> 00:29:42,880
Get up, Xiong.

255
00:29:53,920 --> 00:29:56,440
Chu, come out. Stop hiding.

256
00:30:07,000 --> 00:30:08,600
I didn't wanna hide

257
00:30:08,680 --> 00:30:11,920
but I didn't wanna hear you tell me off.

258
00:30:12,880 --> 00:30:14,520
If you knew I was gonna tell you off,

259
00:30:14,600 --> 00:30:16,040
why didn't you behave?

260
00:30:17,040 --> 00:30:17,960
And look at you.

261
00:30:18,040 --> 00:30:20,120
You're a woman.
Why are you dressed like this?

262
00:30:21,320 --> 00:30:22,600
Jeez.

263
00:30:22,680 --> 00:30:24,400
I usually show more skin.

264
00:30:26,560 --> 00:30:27,640
Stop arguing.

265
00:30:27,720 --> 00:30:30,080
This is me worrying about you.

266
00:30:30,160 --> 00:30:31,240
You go out at night

267
00:30:31,320 --> 00:30:32,640
in revealing clothes.

268
00:30:32,720 --> 00:30:34,160
-What if you get assaulted?
-Hey!

269
00:30:34,240 --> 00:30:35,880
Great-Great-Grandfather,

270
00:30:35,960 --> 00:30:38,560
I have the right to dress however I want.

271
00:30:38,640 --> 00:30:40,800
Those who should be condemned and punished

272
00:30:40,880 --> 00:30:43,440
are sexual predators.

273
00:30:43,520 --> 00:30:46,040
Don't blame the victims.

274
00:30:47,160 --> 00:30:49,760
Rat, look at your daughter.

275
00:30:51,160 --> 00:30:52,920
Great-Grandfather.

276
00:30:57,920 --> 00:30:59,240
It's almost midnight.

277
00:31:00,040 --> 00:31:01,320
Grandpa, Mom.

278
00:31:01,400 --> 00:31:02,520
Don't worry.

279
00:31:02,600 --> 00:31:05,400
He's like this every night.
Aren't you used to it yet?

280
00:31:16,320 --> 00:31:18,720
Great-Grandfather is pitiable.

281
00:31:19,880 --> 00:31:21,240
How is he pitiable?

282
00:31:21,320 --> 00:31:23,280
It's wonderful being him.

283
00:31:23,360 --> 00:31:25,400
He doesn't get sick or die.

284
00:31:25,480 --> 00:31:26,840
I still remember.

285
00:31:28,680 --> 00:31:30,320
When I was little,

286
00:31:30,400 --> 00:31:32,400
he saved me

287
00:31:32,480 --> 00:31:33,560
and got cut by a knife.

288
00:31:44,880 --> 00:31:46,360
Are you ok, Chu?

289
00:31:49,680 --> 00:31:52,800
Oh, Chu, it's ok. Chu, don't be afraid.

290
00:31:52,880 --> 00:31:54,400
I'm fine.

291
00:31:54,480 --> 00:31:55,520
I'll be fine.

292
00:31:55,600 --> 00:31:57,120
I'll be fine. Look.

293
00:32:00,200 --> 00:32:03,000
The wound vanished in no time.

294
00:32:03,080 --> 00:32:05,760
That wound didn't vanish.

295
00:32:06,920 --> 00:32:09,000
Even though his body

296
00:32:10,000 --> 00:32:12,000
seems to heal itself,

297
00:32:13,720 --> 00:32:15,000
every night

298
00:32:15,080 --> 00:32:19,480
the Five-Colored Stone poison
runs throughout his body

299
00:32:20,320 --> 00:32:24,520
and all the wounds the stone once healed

300
00:32:25,120 --> 00:32:27,160
reappear.

301
00:33:01,640 --> 00:33:03,280
This year is the last year.

302
00:33:06,640 --> 00:33:07,640
Ms. Wad,

303
00:33:12,440 --> 00:33:14,880
will our destiny end here?

304
00:33:45,760 --> 00:33:47,200
Ah!

305
00:33:47,280 --> 00:33:48,720
All right, everyone.

306
00:33:48,800 --> 00:33:50,440
In only two months,

307
00:33:50,520 --> 00:33:53,000
Goddess Nu Wa's birthday will be here.

308
00:33:53,080 --> 00:33:57,720
I, Doctor Tao, invite all of you believers
to pay her your respects.

309
00:33:58,280 --> 00:34:00,680
I guarantee this year

310
00:34:00,760 --> 00:34:02,680
our shrine will hold an event

311
00:34:02,760 --> 00:34:05,720
more epic than previous years.

312
00:34:05,800 --> 00:34:07,440
I hope you all come.

313
00:34:09,880 --> 00:34:11,000
Everyone,

314
00:34:11,080 --> 00:34:13,320
a handsome man is paying his respects.

315
00:34:13,880 --> 00:34:15,600
Let's talk to him.

316
00:34:19,800 --> 00:34:20,880
Mr. Handsome.

317
00:34:21,719 --> 00:34:22,880
Mr. Handsome.

318
00:34:22,960 --> 00:34:24,000
Mr. Hand--

319
00:34:28,239 --> 00:34:29,880
Jeez, Mr. San.

320
00:34:30,480 --> 00:34:31,719
Please do me a favor.

321
00:34:31,800 --> 00:34:34,639
Look, the last time I caught you on video,

322
00:34:34,719 --> 00:34:36,199
people praised your look.

323
00:34:36,280 --> 00:34:39,280
Lots of women watched it
and left lots of comments.

324
00:34:39,880 --> 00:34:42,159
You might get a new girlfriend.

325
00:34:43,239 --> 00:34:44,080
Tao,

326
00:34:44,840 --> 00:34:46,679
I'm not an insatiable cheater.

327
00:34:47,400 --> 00:34:50,360
The only woman
I'm interested in is Ms. Wad.

328
00:34:53,920 --> 00:34:55,560
How is it today?

329
00:36:17,000 --> 00:36:18,400
It's still the same.

330
00:36:19,040 --> 00:36:21,800
According to my predecessors,

331
00:36:21,880 --> 00:36:25,320
when the goddess
allows you to find Ms. Wad,

332
00:36:25,400 --> 00:36:27,400
the Five-Colored Stone
will give us a signal.

333
00:36:28,360 --> 00:36:31,160
But I've been checking every day.

334
00:36:31,240 --> 00:36:33,320
I haven't received any signal.

335
00:36:35,840 --> 00:36:38,480
Time will run out in two months.

336
00:36:39,120 --> 00:36:41,560
By then your body

337
00:36:41,640 --> 00:36:44,600
will break down and turn into dust

338
00:36:44,680 --> 00:36:46,560
and you will die a painful death.

339
00:36:49,560 --> 00:36:50,760
Thanks a lot, Tao,

340
00:36:51,360 --> 00:36:54,080
for reminding me I'll die a painful death.

341
00:37:04,480 --> 00:37:06,400
Hey, Mr. San!

342
00:37:10,600 --> 00:37:12,120
The Five-Colored Stone's glowing.

343
00:37:13,000 --> 00:37:14,280
That means…

344
00:37:15,760 --> 00:37:17,840
You're about to find Ms. Wad!

345
00:37:42,200 --> 00:37:43,880
I calculated everything.

346
00:37:43,960 --> 00:37:45,240
The location

347
00:37:45,320 --> 00:37:48,440
we'll find Ms. Wad is in the southwest

348
00:37:48,520 --> 00:37:50,480
which signifies the big earth element.

349
00:37:50,560 --> 00:37:53,280
It's the direction that creates
love and relationships.

350
00:37:53,360 --> 00:37:55,080
We'll start from the market entrance

351
00:37:55,160 --> 00:37:57,280
and walk 10,000 steps.

352
00:38:02,480 --> 00:38:05,120
Nine thousand, nine hundred, ninety-eight…

353
00:38:05,720 --> 00:38:09,040
-Nine thousand, nine hundred, ninety…
-Oh, Dad!

354
00:38:09,120 --> 00:38:10,480
How are you, Dad?

355
00:38:10,560 --> 00:38:11,560
I'm fine.

356
00:38:11,640 --> 00:38:12,680
But…

357
00:38:13,200 --> 00:38:15,800
Jeez, what was my count?

358
00:38:15,880 --> 00:38:17,720
Nine thousand, nine hundred, ninety-eight…

359
00:38:17,800 --> 00:38:19,240
-Jeez, Grandpa,
-Or--

360
00:38:19,320 --> 00:38:21,200
why are you worried about the count?

361
00:38:21,280 --> 00:38:22,520
Here.

362
00:38:25,040 --> 00:38:26,080
OUTDOOR WALK, UNSET, 9,999

363
00:38:26,160 --> 00:38:27,440
Just one more step.

364
00:39:09,400 --> 00:39:10,640
Maybe she is…

365
00:39:12,760 --> 00:39:13,640
Ms. Wad?

366
00:39:15,080 --> 00:39:16,720
How did you know my name?

367
00:39:18,640 --> 00:39:19,480
She's not the one.

368
00:39:19,560 --> 00:39:20,400
Eh?

369
00:39:24,520 --> 00:39:26,800
But my name is really Mueanwad.

370
00:39:27,480 --> 00:39:28,680
Close but not quite.

371
00:39:28,760 --> 00:39:30,680
You're not the one I'm looking for.

372
00:39:30,760 --> 00:39:32,200
I'm sorry.

373
00:39:36,400 --> 00:39:38,960
-Thank you for your help.
-Sure.

374
00:39:45,400 --> 00:39:48,040
Eh? You said we'd find her
after 10,000 steps.

375
00:39:48,120 --> 00:39:49,480
Where?

376
00:39:49,560 --> 00:39:51,280
Besides the distance,

377
00:39:51,360 --> 00:39:53,760
the direction and time also matter.

378
00:39:54,520 --> 00:39:57,080
That woman came from the wrong direction

379
00:39:57,160 --> 00:39:58,320
and at the wrong time.

380
00:39:59,240 --> 00:40:00,880
According to my calculation,

381
00:40:00,960 --> 00:40:05,640
the real Ms. Wad will come from…

382
00:40:05,720 --> 00:40:06,960
this direction.

383
00:40:07,040 --> 00:40:09,600
And in

384
00:40:09,680 --> 00:40:10,520
nine,

385
00:40:10,600 --> 00:40:11,520
eight,

386
00:40:11,600 --> 00:40:12,520
seven,

387
00:40:12,600 --> 00:40:13,680
six,

388
00:40:13,760 --> 00:40:14,760
five,

389
00:40:14,840 --> 00:40:15,800
four,

390
00:40:15,880 --> 00:40:16,800
three,

391
00:40:17,400 --> 00:40:18,520
two,

392
00:40:18,600 --> 00:40:20,200
one.

393
00:40:20,280 --> 00:40:21,640
-Oh!
-Huh?

394
00:41:01,640 --> 00:41:03,360
Grandfather, no, San, how are you?

395
00:41:03,440 --> 00:41:04,440
How are you?

396
00:41:04,520 --> 00:41:05,640
I'm fine.

397
00:41:07,160 --> 00:41:08,280
Who are you?

398
00:41:11,960 --> 00:41:13,800
-Are you okay?
-I'm fine.

399
00:41:17,840 --> 00:41:20,200
-This is the one!
-Huh?

400
00:41:21,560 --> 00:41:23,080
Ms. Wad.

401
00:41:28,200 --> 00:41:29,720
-Huh?
-Huh?

402
00:41:31,360 --> 00:41:32,640
What are you talking about, Tao?

403
00:41:33,400 --> 00:41:34,760
This is her, Mr. San.

404
00:41:34,840 --> 00:41:36,480
The real Ms. Wad.

405
00:41:45,720 --> 00:41:46,560
Wad?

406
00:41:49,880 --> 00:41:51,920
Eh? Great-Great-Grandfather!

407
00:41:52,000 --> 00:41:54,440
-San!
-Great-Grandfather!

408
00:41:54,520 --> 00:41:55,720
Oh!

409
00:41:55,800 --> 00:41:56,800
Great-Great-Grandfather!

410
00:41:58,280 --> 00:41:59,200
Ms. Wad?

411
00:42:02,720 --> 00:42:04,720
Wee!

412
00:42:04,800 --> 00:42:06,200
I heard you fell from a scaffold.

413
00:42:06,280 --> 00:42:07,160
Are you okay?

414
00:42:07,880 --> 00:42:08,960
I'm fine.

415
00:42:09,040 --> 00:42:10,200
He caught me in time.

416
00:42:10,280 --> 00:42:11,400
Who?

417
00:42:23,200 --> 00:42:25,480
Congratulations, Great-Great-Grandfather,

418
00:42:25,560 --> 00:42:27,560
on the fact that your Ms. Wad

419
00:42:27,640 --> 00:42:29,440
isn't an old lady or an uggo,

420
00:42:29,520 --> 00:42:31,600
but a handsome guy with a cute face.

421
00:42:34,760 --> 00:42:37,080
Tao, this is a mistake, right?

422
00:42:37,160 --> 00:42:38,600
You miscalculated, right?

423
00:42:39,600 --> 00:42:42,640
Based on the planetary positions,
date, time and direction,

424
00:42:42,720 --> 00:42:43,920
everything was correct.

425
00:42:44,000 --> 00:42:47,440
That guy is Ms. Wad reborn.

426
00:42:47,520 --> 00:42:48,560
Impossible!

427
00:43:07,560 --> 00:43:11,360
You have 100 years to find Ms. Wad.

428
00:43:14,520 --> 00:43:16,000
I'll do anything.

429
00:43:16,080 --> 00:43:17,520
I'll face torment.

430
00:43:17,600 --> 00:43:19,760
As long as Ms. Wad and I

431
00:43:20,560 --> 00:43:22,400
get to share a destiny again.

432
00:43:22,480 --> 00:43:25,400
The Five-Colored Stone's glowing.
That means…

433
00:43:25,480 --> 00:43:27,280
This is her, Mr. San.

434
00:43:27,360 --> 00:43:29,000
The real Ms. Wad.

435
00:43:33,000 --> 00:43:34,240
Wad?

436
00:44:00,680 --> 00:44:03,960
BAO GONG SHRINE

437
00:44:12,840 --> 00:44:13,760
Goddess,

438
00:44:14,600 --> 00:44:16,480
I just moved here

439
00:44:16,560 --> 00:44:18,160
so I'm introducing myself.

440
00:44:18,240 --> 00:44:19,800
Please protect me.

441
00:44:29,280 --> 00:44:30,480
Mister.

442
00:44:30,560 --> 00:44:32,600
Do you remember me?
The guy you saved yesterday.

443
00:44:34,360 --> 00:44:35,200
Mister.

444
00:44:41,120 --> 00:44:42,040
It's okay, Mister.

445
00:44:52,800 --> 00:44:53,720
Ow.

446
00:45:26,360 --> 00:45:27,960
Mister!

447
00:45:28,880 --> 00:45:29,960
Mister!

448
00:45:38,520 --> 00:45:40,960
The red thread of fate
ties destined lovers.

449
00:45:42,000 --> 00:45:43,200
That's absurd.

450
00:45:43,280 --> 00:45:44,280
Tao,

451
00:45:44,360 --> 00:45:45,520
that kid can't be Ms. Wad.

452
00:45:45,600 --> 00:45:49,000
-Calculate it again.
-Jeez, Mr. San.

453
00:45:49,080 --> 00:45:52,200
I calculated it multiple times
and got the same result.

454
00:45:52,280 --> 00:45:53,680
Eh? Wait.

455
00:45:55,320 --> 00:45:56,440
My ring.

456
00:46:24,320 --> 00:46:25,400
Mister!

457
00:46:26,040 --> 00:46:26,920
Mister!

458
00:46:54,720 --> 00:46:58,040
CT SUPERMARKET

459
00:47:13,760 --> 00:47:15,920
I played Natasha and investigated for you.

460
00:47:16,520 --> 00:47:17,800
His name is Wee.

461
00:47:17,880 --> 00:47:19,840
He just got a part-time job here.

462
00:47:19,920 --> 00:47:23,440
He's sweet, lighthearted and playful.

463
00:47:32,120 --> 00:47:33,480
Then go in and ask him

464
00:47:33,560 --> 00:47:35,800
if he has my jade ring.

465
00:47:35,880 --> 00:47:37,320
I couldn't find it at the shrine.

466
00:47:38,400 --> 00:47:40,640
Why don't you ask him yourself?

467
00:47:40,720 --> 00:47:44,600
Get to know each other.
You two might hit it off.

468
00:48:05,120 --> 00:48:06,080
Better if it's you…

469
00:48:06,160 --> 00:48:07,360
Chu!

470
00:49:09,680 --> 00:49:10,960
Mister! Wait!

471
00:49:11,600 --> 00:49:13,440
Hold up!

472
00:49:14,200 --> 00:49:15,040
We meet again.

473
00:49:18,080 --> 00:49:19,800
I haven't thanked you yet.

474
00:49:19,880 --> 00:49:21,640
If you didn't save me the other day,

475
00:49:21,720 --> 00:49:23,080
I would have died.

476
00:49:24,280 --> 00:49:26,360
Why didn't you finish
your food before speaking?

477
00:49:27,680 --> 00:49:29,320
I have a short break.

478
00:49:29,400 --> 00:49:30,800
Gotta eat and go back to work.

479
00:49:30,880 --> 00:49:31,760
Oh, my name is…

480
00:49:31,840 --> 00:49:33,000
I don't wanna know.

481
00:49:38,520 --> 00:49:40,000
I lost my ring yesterday.

482
00:49:40,600 --> 00:49:41,520
Have you seen it?

483
00:49:42,120 --> 00:49:43,160
A ring?

484
00:49:44,480 --> 00:49:45,600
The green ring, right?

485
00:49:47,280 --> 00:49:50,120
It's an emperor jade.
Impossible to find these days.

486
00:49:50,800 --> 00:49:52,840
Wow.

487
00:49:52,920 --> 00:49:54,560
It must be super expensive.

488
00:49:54,640 --> 00:49:55,520
Right?

489
00:49:56,520 --> 00:49:58,560
Its price can't compare
to its sentiment value.

490
00:49:58,640 --> 00:50:00,160
Give it back.

491
00:50:04,360 --> 00:50:05,560
Hey!

492
00:50:05,640 --> 00:50:06,920
Are you a dog?

493
00:50:07,480 --> 00:50:09,160
Give me back my ring.

494
00:50:09,240 --> 00:50:10,800
So we don't have to see each other again.

495
00:50:10,880 --> 00:50:14,040
It's at my apartment.
You have to get it there.

496
00:50:14,640 --> 00:50:16,920
But you have to wait until I get off work.

497
00:50:17,800 --> 00:50:19,160
Or you can…

498
00:50:19,240 --> 00:50:20,720
leave me your number.

499
00:50:20,800 --> 00:50:22,680
We'll meet up for your ring later.

500
00:51:15,760 --> 00:51:17,240
Take a seat.

501
00:51:17,320 --> 00:51:18,680
It's okay.

502
00:51:18,760 --> 00:51:19,760
I have to rush back.

503
00:51:21,520 --> 00:51:22,960
I see. Give me a sec.

504
00:51:33,920 --> 00:51:34,760
You live alone?

505
00:51:37,080 --> 00:51:38,120
Yes.

506
00:51:54,400 --> 00:51:55,320
Give me a sec.

507
00:52:09,400 --> 00:52:10,400
I'll get it for you.

508
00:52:21,680 --> 00:52:22,960
Come on, I'll help.

509
00:52:44,400 --> 00:52:46,360
Can you let go of my hand?

510
00:52:46,440 --> 00:52:47,920
So I can return your ring.

511
00:52:59,360 --> 00:53:01,120
Here you go.

512
00:53:02,200 --> 00:53:03,640
Thanks.

513
00:53:49,360 --> 00:53:52,080
Goddess, why is fate playing a joke on me?

514
00:53:52,160 --> 00:53:53,800
Please tell me

515
00:53:53,880 --> 00:53:56,120
the kid called Wee isn't Ms. Wad.

516
00:53:57,720 --> 00:54:00,720
I think she's more than kind to allow you

517
00:54:00,800 --> 00:54:02,440
to live to this day.

518
00:54:03,200 --> 00:54:05,080
Don't be so spoiled, Mr. San.

519
00:54:06,160 --> 00:54:08,280
We finally found Ms. Wad.

520
00:54:08,360 --> 00:54:10,640
Just wait for the anniversary

521
00:54:10,720 --> 00:54:15,080
and let him feed you the other half of
the stone to perform the reverse ceremony.

522
00:54:15,160 --> 00:54:17,120
Then it's over.

523
00:54:20,840 --> 00:54:21,680
But…

524
00:54:22,560 --> 00:54:24,640
I promised the goddess

525
00:54:24,720 --> 00:54:26,280
if I ever meet Ms. Wad again,

526
00:54:26,840 --> 00:54:29,640
I'm gonna love and cherish her

527
00:54:29,720 --> 00:54:31,000
and we won't be parted again.

528
00:54:32,760 --> 00:54:34,760
Then you have to make it happen.

529
00:54:34,840 --> 00:54:37,880
You must not break your promise.

530
00:54:39,200 --> 00:54:42,520
The goddess may seem kind,
but when she's angry,

531
00:54:42,600 --> 00:54:44,040
she can be very scary.

532
00:54:44,120 --> 00:54:45,760
Do you remember

533
00:54:45,840 --> 00:54:48,120
in the novel Investiture of the Gods,

534
00:54:49,040 --> 00:54:51,040
Zhou Wang offended the goddess

535
00:54:51,120 --> 00:54:53,200
so she sends the nine-tailed fox

536
00:54:53,280 --> 00:54:54,960
to punish him and end his dynasty.

537
00:55:06,960 --> 00:55:07,880
Tao,

538
00:55:08,400 --> 00:55:10,120
are you sure you didn't miscalculate?

539
00:55:12,640 --> 00:55:13,880
How about this?

540
00:55:14,440 --> 00:55:17,080
Go and ask that guy

541
00:55:17,160 --> 00:55:18,720
if he has a female twin.

542
00:55:19,800 --> 00:55:23,400
Sometimes twins have similar fates.

543
00:57:48,000 --> 00:57:51,760
Do you have a female twin?

544
00:58:01,640 --> 00:58:02,480
Nope.

545
00:58:02,560 --> 00:58:03,960
Eh?

546
00:58:04,040 --> 00:58:05,600
Why did you hesitate if you don't?

547
00:58:08,320 --> 00:58:09,400
Mister.

548
00:58:09,480 --> 00:58:10,440
-Mister.
-Hey.

549
00:58:11,160 --> 00:58:12,160
What?

550
00:58:14,200 --> 00:58:16,640
I don't know what's going on with me.

551
00:58:19,160 --> 00:58:21,120
But ever since I met you,

552
00:58:21,960 --> 00:58:24,120
I can't stop thinking about you.

553
00:58:28,240 --> 00:58:29,840
I have a feeling the two of us…

554
00:58:31,280 --> 00:58:32,680
knew each other once.

555
00:58:42,760 --> 00:58:43,720
I…

556
00:58:46,040 --> 00:58:47,040
I…

557
00:58:47,120 --> 00:58:49,200
I must be going insane

558
00:58:49,800 --> 00:58:52,200
for saying this to a stranger
out of nowhere.

559
00:58:56,320 --> 00:58:58,000
But I mean it, Mister.

560
00:58:58,600 --> 00:59:00,160
I've been waiting for you

561
00:59:01,480 --> 00:59:02,560
for so long.

562
00:59:04,040 --> 00:59:05,760
If I'm parted from you again,

563
00:59:05,840 --> 00:59:08,360
I… I'll probably die.

564
00:59:15,240 --> 00:59:16,280
Ms. Wad.

565
00:59:19,920 --> 00:59:22,080
Ms. Wad!

566
00:59:23,080 --> 00:59:24,400
Ms. Wad!

567
01:00:55,960 --> 01:00:56,920
I'm screwed.

568
01:01:09,200 --> 01:01:12,320
I met a guy. He seemed strange.

569
01:01:12,400 --> 01:01:14,520
He feels familiar like you knew him

570
01:01:14,600 --> 01:01:15,840
or is it love at first sight?

571
01:01:18,120 --> 01:01:19,440
Did you find Ms. Wad?

572
01:01:19,520 --> 01:01:22,120
I had my cop friend look into it.

573
01:01:24,040 --> 01:01:26,240
Based on Wee's time of birth,
he's not Ms. Wad, right?

574
01:01:29,000 --> 01:01:30,000
Why did you bring me here?

575
01:01:30,080 --> 01:01:32,200
I just wanted to prove something.

576
01:01:34,840 --> 01:01:36,280
Can you recall anything?

577
01:02:26,680 --> 01:02:29,320
